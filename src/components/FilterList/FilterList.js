    // But modern interfaces don't usually have an explicit button and filtering action is rather intiated by...
    // ... by just updating the list of filters
    // This requires an algorithm which would handle changes in a list of filters and backend request queue
    // If too many requests are made within a limited time range, latter requests should be dismissed

    // The problem is that any time the state is updated, the whole component rerenders (AllProducts in this case)
    // Maybe it's okay for now
